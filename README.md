## General Gameplay: 
Players try to copy melodies by playing them on a virtual piano in order to earn points. However, you only have a certain amount of time to perfectly replicate each melody, or else the game is over. All melodies are randomly generated! This game will help players better distinguish between different tones and sounds and will also help players new to music learn different scales.

## Requires 
* A working browser!

## Choosing a Level:
The player can choose 1 out of 3 starting levels; Easy, Medium, Hard. 
All levels will increase in difficulty based on how many melodies are successfully replicated, so an easy level will eventually reach hard difficulty. 

## Score Calculation:
Points are awarded every time the player correctly copies a melody. The faster you copy a melody, and the more difficult a melody is, the more points you get! As the levels get higher, so do the rewards. Certain actions will even award you bonus points.

Before you even start the game, you can add modifiers that will make the game more difficult but will also award you more points per melody!

## Statistics:
After every complete game, your score on all melodies is recorded for that session. There will be a staticstics screen where you can view all this information. This is a great way to see your progress as you play!
