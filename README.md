# Melody Matcher

Melody Matcher is a web game that tests your ability to playback randomly generated melodies using a virtual keyboard.
Correctly replicating melodies will earn you points; the harder the melody, the more points you get!
However, you only have a certain amount of time to perfectly replicate each melody, or else the game is over.
This game will help players better distinguish between different tones and sounds, it doesn't matter if you're a casual music listener or an experienced musician!

## Choosing a Difficulty
The player can choose out of 3 starting difficulties; Easy, Medium, Hard. 
The chosen difficulty effects how much time you get per melody.
Choosing a harder difficulty will give you a higher score multiplier.

* Easy - 60 seconds
* Medium - 40 seconds
* Hard - 20 seconds

## Libraries
Melody Matcher just uses [SoundJS](http://www.createjs.com/SoundJS), which is for managing and playing back sounds.
Everything is written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
