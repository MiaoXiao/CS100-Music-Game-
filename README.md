## Gameplay: 
Players try to copy randomly generated melodies by playing them on a virtual piano in order to earn points.
However, you only have a certain amount of time to perfectly replicate each melody, or else the game is over.
This game will help players better distinguish between different tones and sounds and will also help players new to music learn how to recognize the distance between notes.

## Choosing a Difficulty:
The player can choose out of 3 starting difficulties; Easy, Medium, Hard. 
The chosen difficulty effects how much time you get per melody.

* Easy - 60 seconds
* Medium - 40 seconds
* Hard - 20 seconds

## Score Calculation:
Points are awarded every time the player correctly copies a melody. The more difficult a melody is, the more points you get! As you get more melodies correct, the melodies get harder, but you get more points per melody. Certain feats will even award you bonus points.

## Statistics:
After every game, your score on all melodies is recorded for that session. There will be a statistics screen where you can view all this information. This is a great way to see your progress as you play!
